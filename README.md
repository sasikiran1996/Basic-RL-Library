# Basic-RL-Library
A library which contains basic RL methods on simple domains

Developed for assignments of CS687 - Reinforcement Learning course

Domains:
  1) Gridworld - Tabular fn. approx
  2) CartPole - Fourier, Polynomial, Tile basis
  3) Mountain Car - Fourier, Polynomial basis

  
Algorithms:
  1) TD - evaluation
  2) Sarsa
  3) Sarsa-lambda
  4) Q-learning
  5) Q-lambda
  6) Reinforce (without baseline)
